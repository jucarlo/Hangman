Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a hidden word and draws dashes for each letter. The other player guesses letters one by one; if a guess is correct, the letter is filled into the dashes. If a guess is incorrect, a part of a stick-figure hanged man is drawn on the gallows. The guessing player wins if they guess the word before the hanged man is fully drawn, and the puzzle giver wins if the drawing is completed first.

### How to Play
+ Choose a word: One player (the puzzle giver) thinks of a secret word. 
+ Set up the game: Draw a row of dashes (underscores) on paper, one for each letter in the word. Also, draw the gallows structure.
+ Guess letters: The other player(s) take turns guessing letters. 
+ Fill in correct letters: If the guessed letter is in the word, the puzzle giver fills in all the corresponding blanks. 
+ Draw the hangman for incorrect guesses: For each incorrect guess, the puzzle giver adds a part to the stick-figure drawing. This typically consists of the head, body, two arms, and two legs. 
+ Win or lose: The guessing player wins if they guess the complete word before all parts of the hangman are drawn. The puzzle giver wins if the hangman drawing is completed before the word is guessed.

#### Tips
+ Vowels first: Players often start by guessing common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to find letters for the blanks. 
+ Keep track of guesses: Cross out guessed letters on the alphabet to avoid repeating them and to help narrow down the possibilities. 
+ Rare letters: Be mindful of rare letters like J and Z, as they can be tricky to place in a word.
